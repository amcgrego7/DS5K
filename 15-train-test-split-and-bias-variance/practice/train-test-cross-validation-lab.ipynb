    "1. **train/test split**\n",
    "2. **k-fold cross-validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Train/test split and k-fold cross-validation both serve two useful purposes:\n",
    "- We prevent overfitting by not using all the data, and\n",
    "- We retain some remaining data to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of cross-validation, the model fitting and evaluation is performed multiple times on different train/test splits of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we can the training and testing validation framework to compare multiple models on the same dataset. This could be comparisons of two linear models, or of completely different models on the same data.\n"
